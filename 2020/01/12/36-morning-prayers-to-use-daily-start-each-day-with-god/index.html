A Morning Prayer for Cares and Concerns</h2><p>Dear Father in Heaven, so much in my life is broken. I have so many concerns and cares, and they weigh me down. While I desire to cast my cares upon You, I find I usually pick them back up again, and they only add more anxiety and stress. Please help me learn to cast my cares on You as I learn what it means to rest and trust in You. In Jesus’ Name, Amen. - <a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/devotionals/encouragement/encouragement-for-today-december-27-2016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrystal Evans Hurst</a></p>
<h2 id="29-To-Depend-on-God-Today"><a href="#29-To-Depend-on-God-Today" class="headerlink" title="29. To Depend on God Today"></a>29. To Depend on God Today</h2><p>I have been struggling with depending on you. I have been trying to carry this thing called “life” on my own. Thank you so much for being my rock and never deserting me. Even though I have been distracted, I always know that I can lean on you in all circumstances. Help me to keep my eyes on you and not depend on myself all the time. In your name, I pray. Amen. - <a href="https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/god-i-need-you.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carrie Lowrance</a></p>
<h2 id="30-For-Hope-Today"><a href="#30-For-Hope-Today" class="headerlink" title="30. For Hope Today"></a>30. For Hope Today</h2><p>Lord, help me to hear you saying, “I am your hope” over all the other voices. Lord, your word says, you are the hope for hopeless so I’m running to you with both hands stretched out and grabbing on to you. Fill me up with hope and give me a tangible reminder today that hope is an unbreakable spiritual lifeline (<a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?t=niv&q=heb+6:19-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 6:19-20</a>). God, you know those things in my heart that I barely dare to hope for, today I give them to you, I trust them to you, and ask that you because I know that you can do more than I could ever guess, imagine or request in wildest dreams (<a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?t=niv&q=eph+3:20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eph 3:20</a>). God, you are my hope and I trust you.

Courage for the Day Ahead</h2><p>God, I want to believe that you’re with me and that I am known and loved by you… but some days, it’s hard. Help me to speak the truth from your Word back to myself. Take it from my head to my heart. Give me peace and wisdom courage to live like a conqueror - because you’ve already given me victory over every challenge and obstacle. Amen. - <a href="https://www.crosswalk.com/devotionals/your-daily-prayer/a-prayer-for-monday-morning-your-daily-prayer-may-15-2017.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Green</a></p>
<h2 id="32-A-Husband-and-Father’s-Morning-Prayer"><a href="#32-A-Husband-and-Father’s-Morning-Prayer" class="headerlink" title="32. A Husband and Father’s Morning Prayer"></a>32. A Husband and Father’s Morning Prayer</h2><p>Lord, I confess that, so often, I miss the point of following You. Christianity is not about being the best husband or Dad, or feeling good about myself. It’s about dying to the world, and living a life of faith in Jesus Christ. It’s about glorifying God with my thoughts and actions, my priorities and my choices. Help me rise above merely chasing after dollars, and trying to get ahead. Help me trust in Your promise to provide, and put my energy into that which pleases You: the stuff that rust and moth cannot destroy. Thank You for the good things You give, and help me focus on that which is true and noble, whatever is right and pure, whatever is lovely and admirable—all things excellent or praiseworthy—may I think about such things, and remember how they reflect Your character. Father, I long for Your holiness. Make me clean, as I prepare for another day of serving and loving You…empowered by Your Spirit, and emboldened by the sacrifice of Your Son Jesus, in Whose Name I pray…Amen! - <a href="https://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/mark-daniels/a-morning-prayer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Daniels</a></p>
<h2 id="33-For-a-God-Honoring-Work-Day"><a href="#33-For-a-God-Honoring-Work-Day" class="headerlink" title="33. For a God-Honoring Work Day"></a>33. For a God-Honoring Work Day</h2><p>Establish the work of my hands by helping me to be productive, patient, focused, and insightful. Keep me from distractions and from technology hindering my work instead of helping it. May your Spirit lead me in my work and help me to be joyful, creative, and worshipful–constantly reminding me of your love and that you’re the reason I have breath in my lungs. Teach me to align my work, family, church life, and rest in a way that would maximize your glory and allow me to bear the most fruit for your kingdom.</p>
<p>And as I work, fix my eyes on Jesus and his finished work on the cross that gave me treasure I could not earn, rest that I could not otherwise experience, and a living hope that will fuel me to work for the glory of God. Amen. - <a href="https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/a-prayer-for-a-god-honoring-work-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Halloran</a></p>

Prayer to Step Out in Faith Today</h2><p>Gracious Father, as we begin a new day, help us to engage your will with a reckless faith. Teach us to trust in you, and help us grow in righteousness. Heavenly Lord, give us the courage to step out in faith this day. Fill our hearts with your spirit, and let us speak your words with pride. - <a href="https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/prayer/are-you-trusting-in-the-mighty-hands-of-god.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debbie Przybylski</a></p>
<h2 id="35-A-Morning-Prayer-of-Praise"><a href="#35-A-Morning-Prayer-of-Praise" class="headerlink" title="35. A Morning Prayer of Praise"></a>35. A Morning Prayer of Praise</h2><p>Father, I praise You today for all that You have done in my life. You are faithful even when I am faithless. Your love pursues me even when I am unlovable. Your forgiveness covers my sin and frees me from its penalty. I praise You for your love and faithfulness to me. Your presence in my life changes everything, empowering me to live each moment of every day, content in knowing You are in control. As I face today, Lord, remind me that no matter what happens, I can praise You! In Your Name, Amen. - <a href="http://crosswalk.com/devotionals/your-daily-prayer/a-prayer-for-when-you-don-t-feel-like-praising-god-your-daily-prayer-september-29-2016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Southerland</a></p>
<h2 id="36-The-Difference-Today"><a href="#36-The-Difference-Today" class="headerlink" title="36. The Difference Today"></a>36. The Difference Today</h2><p><em>I got up early one morning</em><br><em>And rushed right into the day;</em><br><em>I had so much to accomplish</em><br><em>That I didn’t have time to pray.</em><br><em>Problems just tumbled about me,</em><br><em>And heavier came each task;</em><br><em>‘Why doesn’t God help me?’ I wondered.</em><br><em>He answered, ‘You didn’t ask.’</em><br><em>I wanted to see joy and beauty</em><br><em>But the day toiled on gray and bleak</em><br><em>I wondered why God didn’t show me</em><br><em>He said, ‘But you didn’t seek’,</em><br><em>I tried to come into God’s presence;</em><br><em>I used all my keys in the lock.</em><br><em>God gently and lovingly chided,</em><br><em>‘My child, you didn’t knock.’</em><br><em>I woke up early this morning,</em><br><em>And paused before entering the day;</em><br><em>I had so much to accomplish</em><br><em>That I had to take time to pray.</em><br>- Author Unknown, <em>The Difference</em></p>
